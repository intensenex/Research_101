Modular design, or "modularity in design", is an approach that subdivides a system into smaller parts (modules or skids) that can be independently created and then used in different systems to drive multiple functionalities. A modular system can be characterized by the following:

(1) Functional partitioning into discrete scalable, reusable modules consisting of isolated, self-contained functional elements
(2) Rigorous use of well-defined modular interfaces, including object-oriented descriptions of module functionality
(3) Ease of change to achieve technology transparency and, to the extent possible, make use of industry standards for key interfaces.[1]
